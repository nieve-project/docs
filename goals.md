## Overview
This document seeks to define and clarify project goals.
This defines the orientation of the project over time and keeps the foundation in place.

## Goals
- Reduce development time.

### Reduce development time
By this we don't just mean the time we spend writing code, we also mean the time it takes to research and learn about the topic.

**Reducing learning time can be achieved by standardizing concepts**. Currently, there is not much information on the internet about how to create a package manager. Many things are scattered and incomplete. Also, in most cases you will have to create a package manager from scratch and without much idea of ​​how to do it. For this reason it is necessary to collect concepts during the creation of the infrastructure or design.

**Avoid rewriting large code bases for the same purpose**. This, within the same project, applies to specific cases, but it is not what we are referring to. We are referring to the different projects that have to apply basically the same concepts to create a package manager, creating everything from scratch.

**Using libraries that offer the necessary features, stability and ease**. Under our approach, it is useless to try to speed up the development process with a hard-to-use library, which constantly breaks users' code, etc.

**Using toolchains and automations** we can avoid repetitive tasks and errors.
